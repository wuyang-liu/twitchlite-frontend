# Twitch-Lite: A Personalized Twitch Content Recommender                           
1. Constructed the front-end using React and Ant Design to deliver user-friendly experience.
2. Created Java servlets to handle HTTP requests, fetched resources using Twitch API and persist in MySQL.
3. Researched multiple recommendation algorithms and extracted game information to implement a content-based one.
4. Deployed the project to AWS EC2 in Docker container for public accessibility.
